#Face Magic

A small web application built with Flask for showcasing and experimenting with convolutional neural networks for age/gender classification and facial feature analysis.

Dependencies:

* [dlib] with python bindings (http://dlib.net/compile.html)
* [keras] with Theano (https://keras.io/)
* Flask

To get this up and running, you will need to compile or install dlib with [boost python] (http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_60_0/libs/python/doc/html/building/installing_boost_python_on_your_.html). Once that is complete, you should be able to install keras through your python package manager such as pip3 install keras. Set up flask and your venv, and start flask!
